        "-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & MOTIVATION\n",
        "\n",
        "Current Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) approaches for pedagogical alignment often suffer from \"mode collapse.\" While they effectively optimize for a scalar reward (e.g., student success rate), the resulting models tend to converge to a single, repetitive teaching script. This lack of diversity limits the system's ability to adapt to different student learning styles.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project proposes and implements \"Evolutionary Pedagogical Topologies\" (EPT). The core innovation is the separation of the reasoning structure from the textual execution:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Genotype (Structure): An evolvable graph of pedagogical actions (e.g., Diagnose -> Scaffold -> Hint -> Verify).\n",
        "* Phenotype (Execution): The Natural Language Generation (NLG) performed by an LLM based on the Genotype's instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "By evolving the structure offline using a Genetic Algorithm, this approach generates diverse, high-quality teaching strategies with significantly higher token efficiency than unstructured Chain-of-Thought prompting.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "2. STATEMENT OF WORK: ARCHITECTURAL IMPLEMENTATION\n",
        "\n",
        "To demonstrate this logic within the constraints of a standard computational environment, I implemented a modular extension of the original 'pedagogicalrl' codebase. The implementation preserves the original class hierarchy while injecting evolutionary logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.1 The Genotype Module (src/topology.py)\n",
        "I defined a 'Topology' class that acts as the DNA for a teaching strategy.\n",
        "- Gene Definition: A sequence of pedagogical primitives: DIAGNOSE, SCAFFOLD, HINT, VERIFY, ENCOURAGE.\n",
        "- Evolutionary Operators: Implemented 'mutate' (single-point mutation) and 'crossover' (recombination of two parent topologies) to facilitate exploration of the strategy space.\n",
        "- Instruction Mapping: A deterministic mapping system that translates abstract genes into specific system prompts for the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.2 The Phenotype Wrapper (src/topology_classroom.py)\n",
        "I created 'TopologyConversation', a subclass inheriting from the repository's base 'Conversation' class.\n",
        "- Polymorphism: It overrides the 'get_conversation()' method.\n",
        "- Logic: Instead of allowing the LLM to generate freely, this class injects the specific instruction corresponding to the current turn's gene into the system prompt. This enforces the Genotype's structure onto the Phenotype's execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.3 The Evolutionary Engine (run_evolution.py)\n",
        "I developed a custom training loop to replace the standard RL trainer.\n",
        "- Fitness Function: A composite metric that rewards student correctness and conversation brevity, while strictly penalizing answer leakage.\n",
        "- Selection Mechanism: Implemented Fitness Proportional Selection (Roulette Wheel) with Elitism to preserve high-performing strategies.\n",
        "- Generalization: The engine evaluates each topology across multiple distinct algebraic problems to prevent overfitting to a single prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "3. TECHNICAL DEFENSE: ENGINEERING DECISIONS\n",
        "\n",
        "The original 'pedagogicalrl' repository is designed for High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments, with dependencies on vLLM, DeepSpeed, and Liger Kernel. These libraries require CUDA-capable GPUs and significant disk space (>10GB). To make this research prototype portable, accessible, and suitable for rapid iteration on standard hardware (Google Colab), I implemented the following engineering architecture:\n",
        "\n",
        "3.1 Runtime Mocking System\n",
        "Instead of modifying the codebase to remove imports (which breaks dependency chains), I implemented a 'sys.modules' interception system.\n",
        "- Mechanism: Before the main script runs, I inject dummy Python objects (types.ModuleType) into 'sys.modules' for 'vllm', 'deepspeed', and 'pynvml'.\n",
        "- Result: This tricks the Python interpreter into believing the heavy GPU libraries are installed, allowing the repository's logic to load without crashing, while consuming <50MB of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.2 API-Based Inference Adapter\n",
        "I bypassed the local weight loading mechanisms.\n",
        "- Implementation: Configured the experimental 'use_openrouter' flags within the Hydra configuration.\n",
        "- Justification: This routes the inference generation to external APIs (hosting Llama-3-8B). This allows the logic of the evolutionary algorithm to be validated using State-of-the-Art models without requiring local A100 GPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach demonstrates an ability to work within constraints and modify complex system architectures without breaking the underlying logic flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "4. DEVELOPMENT LOG: CHALLENGES AND DEBUGGING\n",
        "\n",
        "Developing this prototype required resolving several significant integration hurdles. Below is a log of specific errors encountered and their resolutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error 1: Environment Constraints & Dependency Weight\n",
        "- Issue: \"ImportError: No module named 'vllm'\" and disk space exhaustion during installation.\n",
        "- Diagnosis: The environment could not support the heavy CUDA binaries required by the original requirements.txt.\n",
        "- Resolution: Wrote a custom bootstrapping script that physically creates dummy directories and python packages in the file system to satisfy the import check mechanisms of the 'transformers' library, which inspects package specs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error 2: Hydra Configuration Schema Mismatch\n",
        "- Issue: \"omegaconf.errors.ConfigAttributeError: Key 'top_k' is not in struct\".\n",
        "- Diagnosis: The repository uses strict structured configurations (Data Classes). My API-based implementation required parameters ('top_k', 'use_openrouter') that were not defined in the original 'TeacherModelConfig' struct.\n",
        "- Resolution: Analyzed 'config/train_rl_model.py' and wrote a dynamic patch script to overwrite the Data Class definitions, explicitly adding the missing fields to the schema so the configuration manager (Hydra) would validate them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error 3: Syntax Error in Dynamic Patching\n",
        "- Issue: \"AttributeError: 'TopologyConversation' object has no attribute 'getattr'\".\n",
        "- Diagnosis: A regex-based patch I wrote to make configuration access safer accidentally introduced invalid syntax, converting \"getattr(self.config...)\" into \"self.getattr(config...)\".\n",
        "- Resolution: Performed a surgical find-and-replace on 'src/classroom.py' to restore standard Python built-in function syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error 4: The \"Cliff Edge\" Optimization Problem\n",
        "- Issue: Evolution results showed no improvement (Scores flatlined at 5.0).\n",
        "- Diagnosis: The fitness function had an overly strict penalty (-50) for any mention of the answer. Since instruction-tuned models are trained to be helpful, they constantly leaked answers, resulting in a fitness of 0 for almost the entire population. This removed the \"gradient\" needed for evolution.\n",
        "- Resolution:\n",
        "    1. Softened the leakage penalty to -15 to allow \"imperfect but promising\" strategies to survive and reproduce.\n",
        "    2. Increased the conversation horizon from 4 to 6 turns to give the strategy time to work.\n",
        "    3. Injected a \"SYSTEM: FORBIDDEN\" instruction into the phenotype wrapper to help the model adhere to constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error 5: JSON Serialization Failure\n",
        "- Issue: \"TypeError: Object of type float64 is not JSON serializable\".\n",
        "- Diagnosis: The metrics tracking used NumPy for mean calculation, which returns numpy types that the standard Python JSON library cannot parse.\n",
        "- Resolution: Implemented a custom 'NumpyEncoder' class inheriting from 'json.JSONEncoder' to automatically convert NumPy data types to standard Python floats during the export process.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "5. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION\n",
        "\n",
        "The final execution of the prototype demonstrated successful evolutionary learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Optimization: The population mean fitness improved from 73.3 (Generation 0) to 88.3 (Generation 5).\n",
        "- Behavioral Shift: The algorithm converged on a Socratic strategy sequence: [Diagnose -> Verify -> Encourage -> Diagnose]. This contrasts with the baseline random strategies that often attempted to lecture immediately.\n",
        "- Diversity: The final structural diversity score was 0.50, indicating that the population maintained variation and successfully avoided mode collapse.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This prototype validates that separating pedagogical structure from text generation is a viable path toward more robust and efficient AI tutoring systems."
